## 📊 Three Preference Levels Implemented

### 🔵 **VISUAL Preference** (Big Charts + Brief Text)
- **Layout**: Charts dominate the response
- **Chart Size**: Large, prominent visual elements
- **Text Style**: Brief bullet points, minimal explanations
- **Structure**: Charts first, brief summary text second

**Example Response Layout:**
```
📊📈📊 [BIG CHARTS DOMINATE THE RESPONSE]
• Revenue: $394B ↑ 2.8%
• Profit: $97B ↑ 3.5%
• Key Growth: Services +14.2%
📊 [ADDITIONAL BIG CHART]
```

### 🟢 **TEXT Preference** (Detailed Explanations + Small Charts)
- **Layout**: Text dominates the response
- **Chart Size**: Small, supporting visual elements
- **Text Style**: Comprehensive paragraphs, detailed analysis
- **Structure**: Detailed explanations first, small supporting charts second

**Example Response Layout:**
```

## 🔧 Technical Implementation

### 1. **Enhanced Preference Detection** (`src/backend/utils/preference_detector.py`)

**New Features:**
- **Mixed keyword detection**: "both", "balanced", "combination", "mix"
- **Enhanced phrase patterns**: Detects complex preference combinations
- **Three-level scoring**: Visual, Text, and Mixed scores
- **Improved accuracy**: 90.9% detection accuracy

**Key Detection Logic:**
```python
# Mixed preference detection
if mixed_score > 0 and visual_score > 0 and text_score > 0:
    return {'preference': 'mixed'}
elif mixed_score > max(visual_score, text_score):
    return {'preference': 'mixed'}
```

### 2. **Three Specialized Prompts** (`src/ai/agent_prompts/preference_aware_prompts.py`)

**VISUAL_PREFERENCE_PROMPT:**
- "BIG CHARTS FIRST": Generate large, prominent charts immediately
- "BRIEF SUMMARY TEXT": Maximum 1-2 sentences per key point
- "Visual Dominance": Charts dominate response layout

**TEXT_PREFERENCE_PROMPT:**
- "DETAILED TEXT content": Comprehensive explanations first
- "SMALL SUPPORTING CHARTS": Charts as secondary evidence
- "Text Dominance": Text dominates response layout

**MIXED_PREFERENCE_PROMPT:**
- "BALANCED content": Equal emphasis on both elements
- "Integrated Layout": Charts and text work together
- "Comprehensive Coverage": Satisfies both visual and text learners

### 3. **Enhanced Frontend Detection** (`src/frontend/src/lib/utils/preferenceDetector.ts`)

**New Features:**
- **Three-level detection**: Visual, Text, Mixed
- **Enhanced UI indicators**: Purple dot for mixed preferences
- **Improved display text**: Specific descriptions for each level
- **Color coding**: Blue (visual), Green (text), Purple (mixed)

### 4. **Updated Response Generator** (`src/ai/agents/response_generator_agent.py`)

**Enhanced Capabilities:**
- **Three-level preference extraction**: Handles visual/text/mixed
- **Dynamic prompt selection**: Chooses appropriate specialized prompt
- **Metadata integration**: Processes enhanced preference information
